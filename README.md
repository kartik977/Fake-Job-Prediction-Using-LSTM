# Fake-Job-Prediction-using-LSTM
There is an increasing statistic for Fake Job postings on Job boards, Fake job postings waste time for potential employees, and not restricting these would allow for increase crime and fraud.
• Primary beneficiaries for this project will be Job boards like LinkedIn, Handshake etc., allowing them to identify and restrict Fake Job postings will enhance the quality of these job boards, also boosting morale among applicants

We used SMOTE to avoid biased and overfitting of data.
• We used Glove vectorization which helped our project to be build faster as vectors are easily understood by the machine.
• We used additional stop words for our data filtering which would help us find fraud job applications according to more nonprofessional words apart from the ones done in the research paper.
• We used Bidirectional LSTM rather than Unidirectional LSTM which helped us give more meaningful output which is very helpful when are finding fraud job postings.

Machine Learning Models Used:
XGBoost
Bidirectional LSTM
